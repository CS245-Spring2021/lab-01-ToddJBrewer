Requirement 2: The run time of the function highestAltitude is O(n) or linear. This is because the function loops n times, and the remaining constants are thrown out.

Requirement 3: The space requirement of the function highestAltitude is O(3) constant. The three variables declared are peak, runningTotal, and i in the for loop, which counts as only 1. Thus there are 3 total variables declared.
